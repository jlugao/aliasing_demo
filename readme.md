# Aliasing_demo

GUI demonstrating the effect of aliasing in sinusoidal waves. 

This project is part of a series of applets being made to demonstrate important Digital Signal Processing concepts using open source resources. Most of the demonstrations and examples currently avaliable in this area are written for matlab or simulink, this stops the users from 1- being able to run the examples freely and 2- editing the source code to make their own version of the applet.

Currently this project is being tackled by me and once I reach version 0.5 

## How to install
The current implementation is cross-platform because I'm using mainly numpy and pyqt, however there is no self-extractor or anything like that so dependencies must be installed manually in linux and ios.

#### Windows

  * Install [PythonXY](https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/).
  * Fork the project and run
  * Install [GIT](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-windows) and make an user account. 
  * Fork the project
  * Go to project folder and run it

#### Linux

  * First install python 2.7 and PyQt4 and pip.

```
sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-pip python-qt4 qt4-dev-tools build-essential
```

  * Then, install the dependencies

```
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

  * Install [GIT](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-linux) and make an user account. 
  * Fork the project. 
  * Go to the project folder and run it.
